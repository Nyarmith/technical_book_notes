## Chapter Lessons

* You can use the search commands in visual mode

* also check out this weird thing `:h Select-mode`
  - Not at all useful

* selection motions like `aw` and `ap` seem to work in visual mode

* vim has three kinds of visual mode (they're technically sub-modes)
  - character-wise visual mode (v)
  - line-wise visual mode (V)
  - block-wise visual mode (C-v)
  - you can switch between these while in visual-mode with the same keys

* gv reselects the last visual selection
  - <C-[> also gets you out of visual mode, similar to insert mode (in lieu of Esc)

* o = go to other end of highlighted text

* Remember, you can re-do visual selection operations with . like anything else
  - especially useful for selective formatting

* Prefer operators to visual commands where possible
  - This is because it doesn't play as well with the dot command (and thus general scriptability)
  - Visual selection doesn't repeat the motion per-se, it repeats the exact character-length selection done by the first motion and applies that exact selection to all further repetitions; the motion's meaning is lost

* With a selection, you can set its contents to upper or lower-case with `vU` and `vu`
  - Recall, these have a normal-mode equivalent in the form of `gU` and `gu`

## Chapter Highlights
* you can use o while selecting things in visual mode to swap the cursor to the other end!
* `it` is a motion that selects the inner tag of someting (e.g. in an xml tag)
